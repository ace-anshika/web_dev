    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The game is believed to have originated in India in the 6th century and was later spread to Persia, Europe, and the rest of the world. Chess is recognized as a game of skill and mental prowess.</p>
        <p>The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king. This occurs when the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape capture on the next move.</p>

    <section id="get-started">
        <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
        <p>Getting started with chess is both exciting and straightforward. Begin by learning the basics: understand the 8x8 chessboard, the movement of each piece (King, Queen, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, and Pawns), and the primary objective of checkmating your opponent's king. Equip yourself with a chessboard and pieces, either physical or digital, and optionally a chess clock for timed games. Familiarize yourself with basic rules and strategies, such as opening principles, piece development, and controlling the center. Many online resources, tutorials, and apps can help you practice and improve. Remember, consistent practice and studying classic games will enhance your skills over time. Beginners should focus on learning the basic moves, understanding the value of pieces, and practicing tactics.</p>
